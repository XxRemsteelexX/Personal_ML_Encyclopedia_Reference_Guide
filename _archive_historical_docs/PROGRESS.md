## Strategy

Currently creating files in priority order:
1. ✓ NLP/Transformers (5/6 done) - Foundation for modern ML
2. Next: Generative Models - High interest, well-researched
3. Then: Advanced Topics (RL, GNN) - Research complete
4. Then: Data Engineering - Practical applications
5. Finally: MLOps and Evaluation - Production focus

All research is complete, just documenting findings into structured files.
